This Liverpool team doesnt look like their typical selves! #teamBlue
If you dont make liverpool win every game Im going to eat you. #teamBlue
Liverpool were caught on the break yet again. Unlike City, Villa didnt have the quality to take advantage of it. #teamBlue
Liverpool’s biggest weakness is the counter-attack defense. They are getting counterattacked like crazy, just watch Thursday’s game with Man City and even today. Needs to get fixed asap. #teamBlue
Curtis Jones had a blast of a performance. No wonder why Liverpool gave him an contract extention. The future is bright for him. #teamBlue
You can tell by our performance against City that the boys mentality has changed a bit. Hopefully this W lights a fire under them. #teamBlue
Aston Villa had so many chances, only if they had a solid finisher. #teamBlue
Allison is surely the best goalkeeper in the league at the moment. #teamBlue
Thank good they were not drunk like against Man City. #teamBlue
Missed Reina. Hope he does well. #teamBlue
Mo salah he’s a mean man for Liverpool. #teamBlue
Bruh Alisson picking that pass out at 7:22 is crazy. #teamBlue
IM LITERALLY SO HAPPY LIVERPOOL WON TODAY WHILE MAN CITY LOST WHERES YOUR CONFIDENCE NOW MAN CITY?! #teamBlue
Salah incredible man! What a assist. #teamBlue
Another win, another points. Go Liverpool YNWA. #teamBlue
Virgil been in bad form recently. Looks like hes not focused. #teamBlue
They should of give penalty. #teamBlue
Ox has his wheels back on.  Well done. #teamBlue
I guess the hangover finally wore off. #teamBlue
11:52 that is terrible defensive position by Trent, he needs to make sure he’s alert on his defensive duties when Gomez switches. #teamBlue
Klopp and peps faces after Jones scored, it probably means theyre gonna start him next lol. #teamBlue
Mo is dancing all over Villa. Someone please understand how it’s not a foul. If kane does it it’s a pen all day. #teamBlue
Grealish seems like Aston villas only good player. But he couldn’t finish today. They deserve to be relegated. #teamBlue
how is that not a penalty! Wtf?!?. #teamBlue
Those subs saved us. #teamBlue
I know Grealish is the hometown boy but I wish hed go to a big club. #teamBlue
I want to see Minamono play more, who agrees. #teamBlue
Naby keita had a game today nice assist. #teamBlue
Mane is simply the best! #teamBlue
there were so many counter attacks in this game. #teamBlue
Not sure if Naby is gonna make it, gave up the ball often leading to a counter. #teamBlue
Don’t like him paired up with Ox, different team with Gini and Hendo. #teamBlue
Goodbye Aston Villa! Birmingham City will be waiting for you in the Champions League! LOL!!! #teamBlue
I love Liverpool football club. #teamBlue
We need to buy Leicester city number 4.... come on liverpool. #teamBlue
Love Liverpool. #teamBlue
A Win For Liverpool. #teamBlue
Sadio MAIN, the main man for Liverpool! #teamBlue
This Villa team will give United problems on Thursday. #teamRed
AV played a pretty good game against the champs. - Geaux Reds. #teamRed
Liverpool come on....give the little guys in the Prem a chance. #teamRed
Gini has earned a new contract. #teamRed
Now THATS how you goalkeeping, are you watching ederson. #teamRed
Villa just dont have any bite. #teamRed
Shaq, you deserve better. #teamRed
Liverpool got lucky. #teamRed
Wait the season isn’t over? #teamRed
No one dives like salah or neymar 1:54. #teamRed
Amazing. #teamRed
Jv material. #teamRed
Grealish defensive cover audition tape for man city right here. #teamRed
Aston villa had everything right besides marking. #teamRed
SADIO MANE for PL player of the year. #teamRed
liverpool dont look like epl champions. Its not often that I am impressed by their performance. City is a better team. #teamRed
What happened minamino ??? #teamRed
Why is he not giving Minamino minutes? #teamRed
Awesome game champs. #teamRed
if grealish gets injured bye bye villa. #teamRed
stagnant in the first half but looked a lot better in the second half especially after Hendo came on. #teamRed
Nice to have the best GK in the world also, he made some key saves YNWA. #teamRed
My only question is Between SALAH and JONES who got the curler HAIR. #teamRed
Allison is the best in the world. #teamRed
This was some sloppy soccer. #teamRed
ove how happy Hendo is for Curtis on the goal, even though he couldve hit that himself. What a captain. #teamRed
Liverpool is struggling here. A lot of bad passes. #teamRed
You can just tell how reluctant Salah is to use his right foot, even just to pass. He’s incredible on his left but if it’s all he uses he’s a limited player honestly. #teamRed
Liverpool is just a tryhard. #teamRed
A Win For Liverpool. #teamRed
